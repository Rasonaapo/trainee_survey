# Trainee Survey App – College of Health

This Django web application was built to collect trainee data (Level 100–400) at the College of Health for the purpose of processing **Ministry of Health Allowances**.

## 🔍 Purpose

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, Google Forms was not a viable option. This app ensures secure collection, storage, and potential export of trainee records for administrative use.

## ✅ Features

- Secure trainee submission form
- Django admin backend for managing records
- Easy export of responses (CSV/Excel)
- Can be deployed to a subdomain (e.g., `forms.cohk.edu.gh`)
- Modular and extendable

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- SQLite (for local) / MySQL or PostgreSQL (for production)
- HTML/CSS templates
